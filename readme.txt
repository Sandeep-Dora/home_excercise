This is a home assignment.

We want to create an employee management system.
The system will create, delete and display existing employees.
The employees reside in entities.json file.
Each employee's id and name are unique.


Operation:
In order to run the server:
1) Install python3.10 and a new venv.
1) Install all the packages inside requirements.txt
2) Run the server by the server.py file from the main.

Tasks:
1) In this assignment, you have to find the bugs in the client and server and fix them.
2) You will also need to write tests for the client and server functionality (from existing test templates + extra).
3) Database: Instead of using the entities file, create a table in some sql-oriented db (like: mysql) and create data access mechanism.
3) Bonus: Some code can be refactored using best-practices

Emphasis:
You don't have to do everything perfect. Just find as many things as you can to improve and solve the main request
for this assignment.
